Regarding the visualization of the hashtags:

here we have a histogram of hashtag frequencies. We cherry-picked a set of interesting hashtags based on our observations, and then made this visualization to present the changes in frequency in 3 hour intervals over time of these hashtags.

The fact that these frequencies change over time and spike and fall in turns suggests that
when the hashtag frequencies spike, the hashtags are 'trending.' The goal of our algorithms is to identify the hashtags (of a much larger set) which are trending at a given point in time.

So we hope that for a selected 3 hour interval, the hashtags that our algorithms say are trending include the ones that are trending at that time in this visualization.




Regarding the visual evidence of the trending tweets:
